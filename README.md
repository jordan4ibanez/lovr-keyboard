# lovr-keyboard
 LOVR-keyboard library translated into typescript for TSTL.

To install, drop ``lovr-keyboard.ts`` into your game's folder. :)

Then you can import it like so:
```ts
import * as mouse from "./lovr-keyboard";
```

### Requirements:

This needs the LuaJIT ffi type declaration installed.
